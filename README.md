### 🔐🔎  
- **Who is riding?** The service is primarily used by men aged 25–54, who make up 78.8% of the base (268.4k out of 340.8k trips). Interestingly, while men ride more often, women (as "customers") take the longest rides, averaging 36.4 minutes.
- **When and how long?** Ridership peaks on Tuesdays (68k trips) during morning and evening commutes, with October being the busiest month at 80.9k trips. However, most users are missing out on the health benefits of cycling; 368.7k total users (332.8k subscribers and 35.9k customers) ride for durations that fall outside the ideal 30–60 minute health window.
- **Where is the activity?** San Francisco is the undisputed hub with 299.2k trips, 107 stations, and 2.6k bikes. Yet, if you are looking for an available bike, Emeryville is the most reliable spot, holding 48.7% of total bike availability (113 bikes).
### 💡🤔 
- The government can hold regular cycling events to increase interest in using bicycles. Even though the break in the latest article, 2021 will still be scheduled. Might after COVID-19 has stopped, this event can be rescheduled.
- The distribution of bicycle rental quotas is evenly distributed in all public areas in San Francisco so that people are not trapped in the minimum allocation wherever they want to rent.
- The government or the bicycle community can increase cycling campaigns related to health issues or energy savings to global warming.
